<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A whipped cream cake is a delightful dessert that features light, fluffy layers of cake sandwiched between generous dollops of whipped cream. The cake itself can vary in flavor, commonly vanilla or chocolate, but sometimes also infused with other flavors like lemon or almond. The whipped cream serves as both a filling and a frosting, imparting a creamy, airy texture to each bite. It's often adorned with fresh fruits, chocolate shavings, or nuts for added flavor and visual appeal. One of the highlights of a whipped cream cake is its lightness; it's not overly sweet or heavy, making it a perfect choice for those who prefer a lighter dessert option. The combination of moist cake layers and airy whipped cream creates a harmonious balance of flavors and textures that is sure to satisfy any sweet tooth.</p>

<h3>Step by Step Instruction</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Prepare your cake pans by greasing them with butter or oil and lining the bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
    <li> In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs using an electric mixer on high speed until they become thick and pale yellow in color, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
    <li>With the mixer running, gradually add the granulated sugar to the beaten eggs, about a tablespoon at a time, until all the sugar is incorporated. Continue beating until the mixture is thick and fluffy.</li>
    <li>Mix in the vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li>Using a spatula, gently fold in the sifted dry ingredients into the egg mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the batter and result in a dense cake.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
    <li>Place the cake pans in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    <li>In a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy whipping cream using an electric mixer on high speed until it thickens and stiff peaks form. If desired, you can sweeten the whipped cream by adding a tablespoon or two of sugar while whipping.</li>
    <li>Once the cakes are completely cooled, place one layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a layer of whipped cream evenly over the top. Place the second layer of cake on top and cover the entire cake with the remaining whipped cream.</li>
    <li>Garnish the cake with fresh berries or other toppings of your choice, if desired.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least an hour before serving to allow the whipped cream to set. Enjoy your delicious whipped cream cake!</li>
