<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a delicious Italian dish that consists of layers of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with various ingredients such as tomato sauce, cheese, meat, vegetables, and herbs. The traditional lasagna typically includes a rich meat sauce made with ground beef or pork, mixed with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs like basil and oregano. Each layer of pasta is usually spread with a generous portion of sauce and then topped with cheese, commonly mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan. Some variations may incorporate vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini between the layers for added flavor and nutrition. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked in the oven until the pasta is cooked through and the cheese on top is melted and golden brown. The result is a hearty and comforting dish with layers of savory flavors and a satisfyingly creamy texture. Lasagna is often served as a main course for family dinners or special occasions, and it pairs well with a side salad and garlic bread.</p>

<h3>Step by Step Instruction</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your recipe, typically around 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions if they are not the no-boil type. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare your tomato sauce: In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant. If using meat, add ground beef or pork and cook until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste (if using), dried herbs, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese with some grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil (if using).</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread a layer of ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until you've used up all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of tomato sauce and a generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the lasagna is heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or basil, if desired. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
